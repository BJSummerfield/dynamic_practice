# BFS Shortest Path

```javascript
const maze = [
["S",".",".","#",".",".","."],
[".","#",".",".",".","#","."],
[".","#",".",".",".",".","."],
[".",".","#","#",".",".","."],
["#",".","#","E",".","#","."]
]
```
Find how many moves it will take to go from "S" start to "E" the most optimal way.

"." is a valid spot and "#" is invalid
